        Male Ligers can reach a length of 10 to 12-feet which makes them slightly larger than even large male lions or tigers in length. They weigh considerably more than a Tiger or Lion. A non-obese male Liger named Hercules was recognized as being the largest living cat on Earth in 2013, when he weighed a total of 922 pounds. He measured 3.33 m (131 in) and stood at 1.25 m (49 in) at the shoulder. <a href="https://factanimal.com/ligers/" class="href">FactAnimal</a>

            <strong>Napolean:</strong> It's pretty much my favorite animal. It's like a lion and a tiger mixed... bred for its skills in magic.
